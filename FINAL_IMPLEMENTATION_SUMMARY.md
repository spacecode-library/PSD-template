# IMG.LY Postcard Editor - Final Implementation Summary

## Overview
This is a complete implementation of a postcard editor using IMG.LY's CreativeEngine SDK. The editor allows users to select templates, edit text/colors, and export postcards as PDFs.

## Key Components

### 1. PostcardEngineEditor.jsx
The main editor component that:
- Uses CreativeEngine (headless mode) instead of CreativeEditorSDK
- Properly initializes and renders the canvas
- Handles template selection and loading
- Manages editor state and selection tracking
- Implements export to PDF functionality

### 2. TemplateSelector.jsx
- Displays available postcard templates in a grid
- Shows template preview, name, description, and features
- Responsive design with hover effects

### 3. EditorToolbar.jsx
- Provides editing controls for selected elements
- Color picker with presets
- Font size controls
- Text alignment options
- Updates based on selected element type

### 4. PSDLoader.js
- Handles loading PSD files into the editor
- Uses @imgly/psd-importer package
- Supports both URL and data URL formats

### 5. Template System
- templates.json contains template definitions
- Each template includes:
  - Name, description, features
  - Primary and secondary colors
  - Optional PSD file path
  - Scene file reference

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start PSD Server** (if using PSD templates)
   ```bash
   npm run psd-server
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open Browser**
   Navigate to http://localhost:5174/

## Features

### Template Selection
- Click on any template card to load it into the editor
- Templates can be basic programmatic designs or loaded from PSD files

### Editing Capabilities
- **Text Editing**: Click on text elements to edit content, color, size, and alignment
- **Color Changes**: Use the color picker or preset colors
- **Fixed Layouts**: Elements are position-locked to maintain design integrity

### Export
- Click "Export PDF" to download the postcard as a PDF file
- Maintains high-quality output at 300 DPI

## Technical Details

### Canvas Rendering Solution
The original issue with canvas not rendering was due to using `CreativeEditorSDK.create()` which expects a DOM element. The solution was to switch to `CreativeEngine.init()` which returns an engine instance with an `element` property that needs to be manually appended to the DOM.

### Key Differences from CreativeEditorSDK
1. Direct engine API access
2. Manual DOM element management
3. No built-in UI components
4. More control over initialization

### Postcard Specifications
- Size: 5.3" x 7.5" (standard postcard dimensions)
- Resolution: 300 DPI (1590 x 2250 pixels)
- Output: PDF format

## File Structure
```
src/components/PostcardEditor/
├── PostcardEngineEditor.jsx    # Main editor component
├── TemplateSelector.jsx         # Template selection UI
├── EditorToolbar.jsx           # Editing controls
├── PSDLoader.js                # PSD file loader
├── templates.json              # Template definitions
└── PostcardEditor.css          # Styling
```

## Usage in App

To use the postcard editor in your React app:

```jsx
import PostcardEngineEditor from './components/PostcardEditor/PostcardEngineEditor';

function App() {
  return <PostcardEngineEditor />;
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Canvas Not Visible
- Ensure you're using CreativeEngine instead of CreativeEditorSDK
- Check that engine.element is properly appended to DOM
- Verify CSS doesn't hide the canvas

### PSD Files Not Loading
- Start the PSD server: `npm run psd-server`
- Check console for CORS errors
- Ensure PSD file paths are correct in templates.json

### Export Issues
- Verify scene has content before exporting
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure proper MIME type for PDF export
